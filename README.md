# DesSoft-EP2-Battleship-Game

This repository contains the implementation of a Battleship game developed as part of the Design of Software (DeSoft) discipline at Insper, a first-semester course in the Engineering program. The project was developed collaboratively by Micaele Gomes and Nathan Braga.

### Overview
The game is a Python-based implementation of the classic Battleship game where players aim to sink each other's fleet of ships. The game includes features for both player and AI-controlled opponent gameplay.

### Usage
To play the game, run the `jogo.py` script. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your moves. The game will display the boards after each turn and announce the winner once all ships of a player are sunk.

We hope you enjoy playing our Battleship game!
